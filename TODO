Features
--------------------

 * Add switch for html output (-f html)
 * Add switch to display the raw pod output. perldoc uses -u (unformatted)
 * Add -l switch to print name of module like perldoc
 * Add -m switch to display module's file in its entirety like perldoc
 * Think about i18n, add -L for lang code like perldoc
 * Add a switch to list all things known to grok (like "ri -l"), -l/--list
   would be  good, but -l and -L are already used above, hm. Maybe -i/--index
   or -t/--toc
 * Somehow detect whether a file is Pod 5 or Pod 6
 * Get rid of redefinition warnings in t/02_source/02_pod6.t


Perl6::Perldoc-related
--------------------
 * Figure out how to wrap lines to $COLUMNS
 * Maybe write an nroff renderer
