Features
--------------------

 * Add switch for html output (-f html)
 * Add switch to display the raw pod output. perldoc uses -u (unformatted)
 * Add -m switch to display module's file in its entirety like perldoc
 * Think about i18n, add -L for lang code like perldoc
 * Add a switch to list all things known to grok (like "ri -l"), maybe
   -i/--index or -t/--toc
 * Somehow detect whether a file is Pod 5 or Pod 6. A simple test might
   be to look for =begin (Pod 6) and =cut (Pod 5)
 * Borrow the S32 function lookup feature (grok -f FUNCTION) from
   Padre::Plugin::Perl6


Perl6::Perldoc-related
--------------------
 * Figure out how to wrap lines to $COLUMNS
 * Maybe write an nroff renderer
