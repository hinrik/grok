=head1 NAME

App::Grok::Resource::u4x - u4x resource for grok

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use App::Grok::Resource::u4x qw<:ALL>;

 # a list of all terms
 my @index = u4x_index();

 # documentation for a single term 
 my $pod = u4x_fetch('infix:<+>');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This resource looks maintains an index of syntax items that can be looked up.
See L<http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/docs/u4x/README>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 C<u4x_index>

Takes no arguments. Lists all syntax items.

=head2 C<u4x_fetch>

Takes an syntax item as an argument. Returns the documentation for it.

=head2 C<u4x_locate>

Takes a syntax item as an argument. Returns the file where it was found.

=cut

__DATA__
=head3 infix:<+>

Adds two numbers together. If either of the things being added is not
a C<Num>, it will be converted to one before the addition. The result
will be of the narrowest type possible.

=head3 prefix:<+>

Converts an object into a C<Num>. In the case of C<List> and C<Map>, the
numeric value is the number of elements and C<Pair>s, respectively. Note
that it's commas and not parentheses alone do not create a C<List>, otherwise
the following might be a surprise:

 say +(4,5,6);  # 3
 say +(4);      # 4

The same surprise does not happen for arrays, though, since they convey
list context:

 my @a = 4;
 say +@a;       # 1

=head3 twigil:<+>

This twigil is deprecated. Use the C<*> twigil instead.

=head3 regex~quantifier:<+>

Means 'one or more of the previous atom'. In other words, it means the
same as C<< <{1..*}> >>.

=head3 regex~assertion:sym<+>

Used before and between character classes inside C<< <> >> assertions to 
indicate the characters included in the match. Thus

 <+digit-[02468]+[4]>

will match all odd digits and the digit 4. 

The plus at the start of an assertion is a no-op and can be left out.

=head3 version~postfix:<+>

The string form of a version recognizes the C<*> wildcard in place of any
position.  It also recognizes a trailing C<+>, so

    :ver<6.2.3+>

is short for

    :ver(v6.2.3 .. v6.2.*)

And saying

    :ver<6.2.0+>

specifically rules out any prereleases.
